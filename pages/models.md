## Key Distinctions


### Club vs Team

A user can own a single club that operates multiple teams. Users will have the opportunity to name their teams separately. Users can have their A-squad be named Foo and B-squad be name Bar.

### Tournament vs League

Tournaments are competitions that pit teams of similar caliber against eachother on a consistent schedule, run and scheduled by the admins. Leagues are public or private, user-created competitions. Leagues can be named for their own, have user-set prizes (based on buy-in prices).
