## Features Explained

### Player Skill System

Each player will have the potential to unlock a set number of abilities that may correlate with either their personalities, position, or playstyle.

### Player Personality System

A multitude of personalities will run rampant through the leagues, from hard-working to natural talent, brooders and emotions that shoot over the moon after a big win. Users will have to manage different personalities within their squad.

### Player Chemistry System

The more players have time to practice and play together, the better their performance on the pitch will be. Some players will gel together quickly while others may take more time.

### Player Face System

Every player will have a unique face with millions of possible combinations of available facial features, allowing every player to make a lasting impact.

### Team Heatmap System

Users will be able to see where their strengths and weaknesses are on the field along with their opponent's. This will allow users to make quick adjustments to their squad to combat another team's strengths or to cover their weaknesses without having to dive deep into numbers. The squad heatmap system aims to create a new way of looking at the game of football.

### Training System

Users will eventually have a plethora of training options for their players. From individualised sessions to group training, users will have the opportunity to customize their training so they can mold the team of their dreams.

### Trading System

What sort of fantasy league simulator would this be if you could not trade your players away? Better yet, you can bring in some expensive, shiny, young talent to liven up your squad! Trading will allow different types of playstyles for all users, giving users the option to buy their talent rather than groom it themselves.

### Home/Away Crowd Attendance

Home field advantage is definitely a thing but so is the support of your travelling fans. Grow your reputation to encourage more fans to follow your team on the road, schedule busses to shuttle them along with the team, or outright ban away supporters' sections in your own stadium. The choice will be yours, but remember that everything has a consequence!

### Ratings Based Tournament/Season Play

Each team will have a rating (elo-esque) that will help match them against evenly matched opponents for regularly scheduled tournaments. This is the base of the game itself and the games that teams MUST play.

### Social (Guild) System / Create-A-League

Create a league with friends (or strangers) to get more regular playing time for your squad and win big prizes. From a single-owner league to democratic leagues with rule-changing votes, you'll have more matches on your schedule than you can handle! The social system gives you opportunities to play the same teams and compete against eachother over longer periods of time.<sup>[Various League Types](#various-league-types)</sup>


### Farm Systems / Multiple Teams

Once you've proven you can be successful, you will have the opportunity to open up a second team to play in divisions below your top squad meaning more players, more games, more money.


### Various League Types

Two types of leagues may become available for creation. The first being a democratic league with rules that are voted on periodically by teams who have ownership in the league. The second would be a league started and owned by a single player with rules set only by them. <sup>∵</sup>
