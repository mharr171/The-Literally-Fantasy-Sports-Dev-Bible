## Player Skills

### Pre-Alpha

+ Single player skills - Abilities that may affect gameplay in a specific manner

### Future

+ Multi-player skills - Similar to single player abilities but may require that multiple players have the ability in order to activate it, or that all 'parts' of the ability are possessed within the squad.

For example, a potential two-part skill could be that you have a Striker with a Bicycle Skill and a Midfielder with a Precision Flick Skill, these two could be combined within a match to devastating ends.

## Player Chemistry

Each player will be on a scale that wraps or connects on both ends. With each practice and game played together, the whole squads chemistry color will move towards the same spot. Particular 'events' may see particular players having their chemistry color jump positions. If two players have an argument their respective colors may move apart from each other. Throw a team party and watch as your team's chemistry color quickly blends together.

## Training System

### Pre-Alpha

Two types of training will be available in the pre-alpha, training individual players and training the squad as a whole. Early on, training will be  simplified, quickly increasing an individual's or the team's skill level as a whole.

### Future

In the future, users will be able to train specifically targeted traits or skills specifically rather than performing general training.

## Reputation System

### Pre-Alpha

Basic reputation system that affects crowd attendance.

### Future

Players with poor confidence or composure may play poorly when facing other players with high reputations.

## Home/Away Crowd Attendance

Crowd attendance will affect more than just your bottom line. Ticket sales are important, but the support your fans give your team can be just as vital. Attendance will affect every player on the field, home or away.
